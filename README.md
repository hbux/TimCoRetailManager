:exclamation: **Important update for the TimCo Retail Manager**

This repository has been moved from GitHub to **Azure DevOps**. 

Looking to [view the Azure DevOps repository](https://dev.azure.com/hb3648/TimCoRetailManager)?

As per phase 2 of the TimCo Retail Manager development, Azure DevOps is now being used as source code version control as of **6th July 2022**, meaning that all files and folders currenly within this repository are outdated. However, [This GitHub](https://github.com/hbux/TimCoRetailManager/blob/main/README.md) will be maintained and updated during the development cycle.

Once the main project features have been implemented, source code veresion control may be transferred over from Azure DevOps back to Github.
