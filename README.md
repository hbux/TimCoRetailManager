# TimCo Retail Manager
A retail management system built by TimCo Enterprise Solutions.

In this simulation, we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions. We build solutions that we can sell to clients. Right now,
we have been assigned to build a retail management system. Overtime, we will get new requirements, or new work entirely,
just like in a real job.

### Purpose

1. To provide a clear demonstration on how to build a real-world application.
2. To demonstrate how various topics fit together.
3. To create a learning platform for future demonstrations.


### Goals

1. Demonstrate modern development techniques.
2. Model how an application grows over time.
3. Create a platform that needs to be upgraded to newer technologies.
4. Create a hands-on learning tool for developers use to simulate a work environment


### Initial Project

We need to build a desktop app that runs a cash register, handles inventory, and manages the entire store. In order to allow
it to grow, though, we will be creating a WebAPI layer. As the initial project requires a desktop application, the customer will
definiately want to move the system online later down the line, without a WebAPI layer, a whole new project would need to be created.

#### Initial Plan
I want to build a MVP (minimum viable product) that we can expand to cover all of teh features we need over time. The first step
is to get all the major pieces set up, including:

* Git on Azure DevOps
* SQL database (SSDT - SQL Server data tools), we may change from using SQL to another service. Keep that in mind.
* WebAPI with authentication
* WPF application that can log into the API - the middle layer that allows the application to use web, mobile or desktop.


#### Upcoming Technologies
Upcoming technologies:
Technologies that we may bring into this application coming down the road. This application will be creating using .NET Framework
* Unit Testing
* Dependency injection
* WPF
* ASP.NET MVC
* .NET CORE
* SSDT
* Git
* Azure DevOps
* Design patterns
* Async
* Reporting
* WebAPI
* Logging
* Data validation
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Authentication
